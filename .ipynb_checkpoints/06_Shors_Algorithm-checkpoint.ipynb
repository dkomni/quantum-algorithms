    "# Shor's Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "In 1994, mathematician Peter Shor developed a polynomial time quantum algorithm for the factoring problem. It is one of the most remarkable algorithms in quantum computing which combines *quantum Fourier transform*, *phase estimation* and *period finding* algorithms that we describe on notebooks *03,04,05* in detail.\n",
    "\n",
    "The best-known algorithm for integer factorization is of exponential time. The factoring problem comes from the *Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic*, which states that any integer $N>1$ can be uniquely expressed as a product of one or more *prime numbers*. This lies at the heart of widely used encryption algorithms, the most famous being *Rivest-Shamir-Adleman (RSA)* cryptosystem. Without much detail, RSA picks two prime numbers $p$ and $q$ to construct the number $N=p \\cdot q$ as one of the public keys and utilizes number theory to encrypt some message. If someone can get those two prime numbers, the message can be easily decrypted. However, number $N$ consists of hundreds or thousand digits, so the two primes are large enough for a classical computer to process the information in a reasonable time.\n",

    "- Pick $x$ randomly in the range $1$ to $N-1$, such that $gcd(x,N)=1$ (*relatively prime*)\n",

    "- If $r$ is even and $x^{r/2} \\neq -1 \\pmod{N}$, then compute $gcd(x^{r/2} -1, N)$ and  $gcd(x^{r/2}+1, N)$.\n",

    "<b>Theorem 1</b> Suppose $N$ is an $L$ bit composite number and $x$ is a non-trivial solution to the equation $x^2 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{N}$ in the range $1\\leq x \\leq N$, that is neither $x \\equiv 1 \\pmod{N}$ nor $x \\equiv N-1=-1 \\pmod{N}$. Then at least one of $gcd(x-1,N)$ and $gcd(x+1,N)$ is a non-trivial factor of $N$ that can be computed using $O(L^3)$ operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Theorem 2</b> Suppose $N={p_1}^{l_1} \\dots {p_m}^{l_m}$ is the prime factorization of an odd composite positive integer. Let $x$ be an integer uniformly chosen at random, such that $0 \\leq x \\leq N-1$ and $x$ is co-prime to $N$. Let $r$ be the order of $x \\pmod{N}$. In such a case,\n",
